Support for functional programming is now included in DollarScript, this will be widened as the language is developed. For now it is provided by the `pure` operator. This signals that an expression or declaration is a pure expression or function.

In this example we're declaring reverse to be an expression that reverses two values from a supplied array. Because we declare it as `pure` the expression supplied must also be `pure`. To understand what a pure function is please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function. Basically it prohibits the reading of external state or the setting of external state. We next swap `[2,1]` within a newly created pure expression, which is subsequently assigned to a. If reverse had not been declared pure it would not be allowed within the pure expression.

{% highlight bash %}
 pure reverse := [$1[1],$1[0]]

 a= pure {
     reverse([2,1])
 }

{% endhighlight %}

Note some builtin functions are not themselves pure and will trigger parser errors if you attempt to use them in a pure expression. Take DATE() for example which supplies an external state (the computers clock).
